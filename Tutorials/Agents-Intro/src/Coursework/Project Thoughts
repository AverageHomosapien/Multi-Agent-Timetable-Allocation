Project Thoughts and Information:


[0-5 preference array for each time for each student]
Scored array based on preference score and times
Times that the student agent has
Threshold which student is 'happy to proceed' but will still request swapping until program over?

Query if - Inform (query if timetable slot available)
Propose - Accept-Proposal / Decline-Proposal (Requesting to move slot)

40 slots across 5 days - translates 09:00 - 17:00
Try 1 slot, move to 3 slots per week per student?

AGENT BASED TECHNIQUE PAPER
Used 2 ontologies: timetable ontology, a Student Request ontology

Timetable agent initiates timetable
Timetable agent assigns timetables to students
Students review timetables
Students with time preferences not yet met query-if the timetable slot is available
Timetable agent Informs (event full or not)
If event full, student broadcasts message to all students requesting swap
Student_responder responds if they can make the swap


How to know when timetable is finished? Not time, based on students 'happy' with their timetable times?

COURSEWORK SPECIFICATION
Students allocated to 1 tutorial group for each module
3 tutorials per student per week?
Limited number of spaces for each tutorial group
Minimum Student Preferences: Timeslots they can't attend, timeslots they'd prefer not to attend, timeslots they'd like to attend

Need:
Ontology that lets agents communicate
Communication protocol (inc. sequence diagrams etc)
A student utility function
A strategy which determines which exchange requests to make, which to accept from others and which to reject
A metric to evaluate the system effectiveness
